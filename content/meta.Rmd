# Why this website ? 

A website is highly useful for yourself to keep track of what you have done and thought. Sometimes you may go back to a certain old post of yours to relearn the tricks or methods you once mastered in the past but have forgotten.

# How is it built ? 

This website is built with [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) which uses a combination of Hugo, Rmarkdown and knitr. 

Its source code is publicly availbale on [github](https://github.com/pokyah-hugo-blog-source). Don't hesitate to fork, appropriate, edit and improve.
