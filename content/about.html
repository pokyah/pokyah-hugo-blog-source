<p>Hi &amp; Welcome on my personnal page,</p>
<p>I’m Thomas, a former Glaciologist with a background in physical geography currently developing skills in supervised machine learning applied to spatial predictions using open source data analysis and GIS software (mainly <i class="fa fa-r-project"></i>).</p>
<p>I’m currently working at <a href="http://www.cra.wallonie.be/fr">CRA-W</a> on the Agromet project which aims to spatialize weather data in Wallonia (Belgium).</p>
